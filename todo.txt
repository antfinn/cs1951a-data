r/hiphopheads vs mainstream audience:
Google trends show how niche Chance The Rapper and Frank Ocean are compared
to those that do well on the Billboard Charts.

Based on the top 1000 posts of all time, we can document the most influential
hip hop events to r/hiphopheads since 2012.
Kendrick Lamar: TPAB, DAMM., Kanye West: TLAP

People on r/hiphopheads talk about highly rated albums more than about
popular albums. Kendrick Lamar, Run the Jewels, A Tribe Called Quest, Vince
Staples all had some of the highest rated rap albums, which generated much
discussion about the artist.

Unique artists:
The balance between rap and r&b. The unique popularity of Frank Ocean.

Gender Bias:
Beyonce, Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Janelle Monae, Erykah Badu
show up less than expected.

Sentiment:
Artist average sentiment not very correlated with artist metacritic score.
For example, Kendrick Lamar has avg score of .12 much less than a typical
artist.
Album sentiment related to album metacritic score. To Pimp a Butterfly has
a score of 0.2, DAMN. only has a score of about 0.11. Why? Many comments were
comparing the album to a previous work. The titles in DAMN. are much more
negative than in his previous work ("Blood", "Lust").


Even though Drake dominates the charts
("Drake currently makes up 13% of the Billboard Hot 100"),
he does not have the impact that Kendrick Lamar, who releases less songs
but more highly rated material does.
